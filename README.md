How to deal with unlabelled data:

Dealing with Unlabelled data:
- based on NDAI, label this as cloud data

Feature Engineering:
- avg of NDAI score around each point 
 
Modelling Notes:
- KNN works well with NDAI (max or min for edge detection)

Train Test Split:
- split up images into blocks, and then use CV 
- leave out 15-20% for validation, don't touch it for training/test
